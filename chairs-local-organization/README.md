# Local Organization Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Local Organization ensures seamless on-site operations, providing logistical support for a welcoming and efficient conference experience. It handles venue management, attendee services, and event execution to support the overall conference success.

- Manage venue logistics, registrations, shuttles, and on-site services.
- Coordinate food, accommodations, and technical setups for smooth operations.

## Chairs' Goal
Local Organization Chairs must oversee all local arrangements, coordinate with teams, and resolve issues promptly. Their focus is on attendee comfort, safety, and efficient resource allocation.

- Coordinate venue, shuttles, food, and registrations for attendee convenience.
- Manage volunteers and technical support for sessions and events.
- Ensure safety, accessibility, and emergency preparedness.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve venue management, attendee services, and event logistics to ensure operational excellence. Chairs handle preparations, on-site coordination, and post-event wrap-up while aligning with conference schedules.

- Coordinate venue bookings, setups, and signage.
- Manage registrations, badges, and attendee check-ins.
- Arrange shuttles, food (lunches, coffee, banquet), and accommodations.
- Oversee volunteers for session support and logistics.
- Ensure technical setups (WiFi, AV, LED) and emergency protocols.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes proactive planning and attendee-centric logistics, adaptable to venue constraints, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific arrangements and tools. This separation allows scaling for different locations and sizes.

- General Advice
  - Plan shuttles based on attendee locations; use apps for updates.
  - Provide diverse food options; monitor quantities for waste reduction.
  - Train volunteers thoroughly; assign based on skills.
  - Ensure accessibility (ramps, interpreters); test AV early.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Logistics: Shuttles from 3 areas; food for 350-450; LED screens and WiFi.
  - Events: Welcome reception, banquet, jam session; awards and gifts.
  - Tools: Checklists; PCO coordination; volunteer assignments.
  - KAIST venue benefits: Fresh air, outdoor spaces, budget savings; isolated location led to high attendance rate (fewer distractions compared to city venues like Seoul).
  - Unlimited coffee/water/snacks all day: Very popular and highly appreciated by attendees.

## Rationale & Consequences
Detailed planning and coordination prevent disruptions, ensuring attendee satisfaction and safety. Inconsistencies can lead to confusion, delays, or safety issues.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures reliable services and clear expectations for attendees.
- If inconsistent/not done: Logistical failures; attendee dissatisfaction; safety risks.
- Alternatives: Outsourced logistics; digital-only services; minimal on-site support.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) Venue Selection and Setup
- Context: Choose and configure spaces for sessions and events.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: On-campus vs off-campus; single vs multiple venues; urban vs suburban/isolated.
- 2025 decision: KAIST campus; multiple buildings for sessions.
- Pros/Cons: On-campus simplifies logistics; off-campus offers amenities. Isolated venues (like KAIST) foster higher attendance and engagement as attendees stay focused on conference activities rather than exploring city attractions. Fresh air and outdoor spaces enhance experience. Budget savings vs city hotels.
- Recommendations: Scout early; test accessibility. Consider venue isolation as attendance strategy – suburban/campus venues may increase session participation compared to downtown locations.

### 2) Shuttle and Transportation
- Context: Ensure easy access for attendees.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with Volunteers).
- Options: Bus vs taxi; fixed vs on-demand.
- 2025 decision: Buses from 3 areas; fixed schedules.
- Pros/Cons: Buses are cost-effective; taxis offer flexibility.
- Recommendations: Provide maps; monitor punctuality.

### 3) Food and Beverage Management
- Context: Cater to diverse needs without waste.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with PCO).
- Options: Buffet vs boxed; inclusive vs standard.
- 2025 decision: Boxed lunches; coffee/tea/snacks; dietary options.
- Pros/Cons: Buffet encourages mingling; boxed is efficient.
- Recommendations: Survey preferences; adjust quantities.

### 4) Registration and Badges
- Context: Streamline check-in for smooth start.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with Volunteers).
- Options: Self-service vs staffed; digital vs physical badges.
- 2025 decision: Staffed desks; physical badges with stickers.
- Pros/Cons: Self-service reduces staff; staffed provides assistance.
- Recommendations: Test system; provide guides.

### 5) Volunteer Coordination
- Context: Assign roles for effective support.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with Volunteers).
- Options: One-day vs multi; specialized vs general.
- 2025 decision: One-day shifts; role-specific (e.g., tech helpers).
- Pros/Cons: One-day lowers commitment; multi provides continuity.
- Recommendations: Match skills; provide training.

### 6) Technical and Safety Logistics
- Context: Ensure functional and safe environment.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with Tech Chairs).
- Options: In-house vs outsourced; basic vs comprehensive.
- 2025 decision: WiFi, AV, LED; emergency protocols.
- Pros/Cons: In-house controls quality; outsourced saves time.
- Recommendations: Test setups; document procedures.

### 7) Photography and Privacy Consent
- Context: Balance documentation needs with attendee privacy.
- Decision owner(s): Local Organization Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: Opt-in vs opt-out; universal consent vs selective.
- 2025 decision: Yellow lanyards for "do not photograph me" option; photos shared via Google Photos (not perpetual storage).
- Pros/Cons: Opt-out respects privacy; visual indicators (lanyards) make it easy for photographers. Google Photos best for preview/sharing but not archival.
- Recommendations: Provide clear visual opt-out mechanism (colored lanyards); communicate storage policy upfront; note that in 2025 practice, no one seemed to use the yellow lanyards, but offering the option was appreciated.

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
